DISCOS: 
* response = request.form.get('username') in app.py and {{username}} in response.html to get inputted username
* method = request.method and {{method}} in response.html to get method used
* GET displays all the info in the webpage in the URL
* query strings (POST method)+ request.args.get() prevents app from failing 

QCC:
* When is it better to use GET than POST?
